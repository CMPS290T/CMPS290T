This directory contains the hr4e_data_model

1. Use XForms code to generate an hr4e patient data file based on hr4e_patient_template.xml 
2. Invoke hr4e_patient_to_ccd.py on the file generated in step 1. 

Two files will be generated for the patient data:
	+	a green CCD compliant .xml file
	+ 	a CDA-compliant .xml file

Files:
hr4e_patient_template.xml: A template for an hr4e patient data instance. It is based on the green_ccd.xsd XML schema
with extensions to capture additional hr4e information that is not defined in the green_ccd.xsd spec.  These elements
are from the hr4e namespace, and so have a prefix of hr4e:.

A patient instance document generated from this template is not CCD-compliant and will not validate against green_ccd.xsd
without first removing the hr4e elements.

hr4e_patient_to_ccd.py: A python script that invokes hr4e_patient_to_ccd.xslt to remove hr4e namespace elements from a
an hr4e patient data file that follows the hr4e_patient_template.xml template. The output of this python script
will generate an xml file that can be validated against the green_ccd.xsd file.

hr4e_patient_to_ccd.py [-i <HR4E patient input file>] 
					   [-g <green CCD patient output file>] 
					   [-c <CDA  patient output file>] 
					   [-hxslt <HR4E xslt file>]
					   [-gxslt <HR4E xslt file>]

<input file> is a patient data instance file. It defaults to hr4e_patient_template.xml in the current directory
<green CCD patient output file> is the name of the green CCD file to be generated.  It defaults to green_patient_template.xml in the current directory.
<CDA patient output file> is the name of the CDA patient data file to be generated.  It defaults to cda_patient_template.xml in the current directory.
<HR4E xslt file> is the name of the xslt file that removes hr4e tags.  It defaults to hr4e_patient_to_ccd.xslt in the
current directory. 
<green xslt file> is the name of the xslt file that transforms a green CCD document to a CDA document.  It defaults to green_ccd.xslt in the
current directory. 

This python script uses a file called the saxon XSLT processor, and assumes that it is in a subdirectory called saxon. 

hr4e_patient_to_ccd.xslt: An XSLT stylesheet to remove elements defined with the hr4e namespace from an hr4e patient data xml file.

green_ccd.xsd: An XML schema file for green CCD xml documents. 

green_cda_narrative.xsd: An XML schem file for green CDA narrative. It is included by green_ccd.xsd and so must be accessible. We assume it is
in the current directory.

green_xslt: An XSLT stylesheet to generate a CDA-compliant model from a file that conforms to the green_ccd.xsd XML schema.
