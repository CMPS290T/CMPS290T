These are sample CCD documents.

SampleCCDDocument.xml was createdd by HL7 and represents canonical example that conforms to the 
CCD specification.  It includes and uses several namespaces and xml schemas defined by HL7.  These
schemas do not seem to be properly handled by XForms and I am not sure why. 

SampleGreenCCDDocument.xml is a simpler example, which does not have the same issue with 
namespaces and schemas.  It's format is in draft stage by HL7, and the goal is to provide
an XSLT stylesheet to convert it to the more complete format as shown in SampleCCDDocument.xml.

SampleXFormForGreenCCD.xhtml is an XForms form that reads in SampleGreenCCDDocument.xml,
displays information that can be edited, and then saved to a new file called PatientCCD.xml

To test this out, put both SampleXFormForGreenCCD.xhtml and SampleGreenCCDDocument.xml in the 
same directory and point your XForms-enabled browser to SampleXFormForGreenCCD.xhtml.
